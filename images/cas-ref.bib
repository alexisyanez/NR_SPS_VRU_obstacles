@article{Thandavarayan2023,
   abstract = {Cooperative perception (a.k.a. Collective perception or cooperative sensing) will allow Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) to share information about detected objects. Cooperative perception improves the sensing accuracy, confidence and range of CAVs, and extends their perception of the driving environment. First message generation rules based on the mobility and dynamics of detected objects have been proposed to decide when a cooperative perception message should be generated and what information it should include. Studies have shown that this type of generation rules can compromise the scalability of cooperative perception and vehicular networks, as they tend to transmit significant amounts of redundant information and generate small and frequent cooperative perception messages that increase the communications overhead. To combat these inefficiencies, this paper proposes and evaluates three techniques that combine, for the first time, baseline mobility-based generation rules for cooperative perception messages with mechanisms to control the redundancy and organize the information about detected objects in order to avoid the frequent transmission of small messages. This study demonstrates that the proposed techniques improve the perception of CAVs and reduce the information age. In addition, the techniques reduce the channel load and improve the scalability of cooperative perception services and vehicular networks. The study demonstrates that the most effective technique is based on: (1) first applying the generation rules to decide whether a cooperative perception message should be generated, (2) then applying redundancy control, and finally (3) organizing the information about all detected objects to avoid small and frequent messages.},

abstract = {The automotive field is evolving towards high levels of automation, requiring seamless data exchange between vehicles through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. Direct V2X technology is already being deployed on commercial vehicles, and it has the potential to deliver a range of safety and efficiency benefits on the road. However, the deployment of V2X-based applications is a complex process that demands extensive testing before these systems can be widely used by the public; indeed, high costs and safety concerns are among the main hurdles to overcome before applications leveraging V2X communication can become a reality. It is thus critical to reliably validate through simulation and emulation both the V2X technologies and the applications in realistic scenarios, before performing large-scale road tests. To address this pressing need, we present an open source framework for the virtual validation of V2X-based applications, amenable to the development and testing not only of different access technologies within the same environment (IEEE 802.11p, LTE-V2X, 5G NR-V2X, and LTE), but also of any kind of V2X-based application using ETSI-compliant messages. Our framework, called ms-van3t, is based on the ns-3 and SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) simulators, it implements a full ETSI C-ITS stack for CAM, DENM and IVIM messages, and it provides several novel features not found elsewhere. Further, ms-van3t enables the testing of V2X-based applications in HIL (Hardware-In-the-Loop) scenarios, thanks to a dedicated emulation mode, and it allows users to easily select different physical and MAC layer models, seamlessly collecting performance statistics. To showcase the capabilities of the framework, we present three sample applications as well as the performance results we obtained in terms of both application-related and network-related key performance indicators.}

Simu5G allows users to simulate the data plane of 5G New Radio deployments, in an end-to-end perspective and including all protocol layers, making it a valuable tool for researchers and practitioners interested in the performance evaluation of 5G networks and services. We discuss the modelling of the protocol layers, network entities and functions, and validate our abstraction of the physical layer using 3GPP-based scenarios. Moreover, we show how Simu5G can be used to evaluate Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) and Cellular Vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) services offered through a 5G network.},

@article{hakeem2020,
   abstract = {Vehicular communication is one of the critical technologies in intelligent transportation system to provide connectivity between vehicles, road side units, and pedestrians. Multiple wireless accessing technologies designed to provide connectivity in vehicular networks such as conventional Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11p, and cellular communications. Recently, cellular V2X (C-V2X) is standardized and designed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP) for automotive services. C-V2X supports two communication modes through a single platform to provide both Wi-Fi and cellular communication. LTE-V2X is the current 3GPPRelease 14 standard that has many enhancements to provide the new 3GPPRelease 16 for the new 5G radio generation. 5G-new radio (NR) is expected to address the automotive capabilities, improvement, and services for 2020 and beyond. 5G-NR becomes a competitive technology compared with other wireless technologies because of extensive coverage, high capacity, high reliability, and low delay support. In this paper, we propose the Optimizing of 5G with V2X, and analyzing the current V2X standards, introducing the development of 5G, challenges, features, requirements, design, and technologies.},

@inproceedings{Hegde2020,
   abstract = {Introduced with LTE Release 14, Cellular V2X enables device-to-device communication to support road safety and traffic efficiency applications. We present Artery-C, a simulation framework for the performance evaluation of Cellular V2X protocols and V2X applications. Our simulator relies on the simulation framework SimuLTE and substantially extends it by implementing control and user planes, a dedicated sidelink interface with specific focus on dynamic mode switching and some advanced features of 5G mobile networks, such as variable numerologies. Artery-C integrates seamlessly into the simulation framework Artery, which enables the simulation of standardized V2X messages at the facilities layer as well as the coupling to the mobility simulator SUMO. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of Artery-C, we evaluate V2X-based platooning as a representative use case and present results for mode 3, mode 4 and mode switching in a highway scenario.},
